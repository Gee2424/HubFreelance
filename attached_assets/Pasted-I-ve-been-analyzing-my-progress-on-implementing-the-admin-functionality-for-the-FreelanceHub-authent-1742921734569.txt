I've been analyzing my progress on implementing the admin functionality for the FreelanceHub authentication system.

Based on my review:

✓ Added admin methods to storage interfaces
✓ Implemented admin methods in SupabaseStorage
✓ Updated admin routes registration in routes.ts
✓ Fixed SupabaseStorage db property accessibility
→ Working on implementing admin route handlers

I'm making good progress on the admin functionality implementation. We just encountered an issue with restarting the workflow, which is likely due to a port conflict, but this is a common occurrence and not a blocker for our development.

I'll continue working on creating the admin route handlers to support the user management features.


Restarted Start application
Now that our server is running, let's update the frontend component to add more functionality for admin user management. We'll enhance the AdminPanel.tsx component to add features for creating, editing, and resetting user passwords.


Opened client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Let's now create a form for password reset and user creation:


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Now let's add the form validation schemas and create password reset and user creation functionality:


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Now let's update the UI to include buttons for creating new users and resetting passwords:


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Let's update the Actions column in the user table to include the password reset button and active/suspend toggle:


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Now let's add the password reset and user creation dialogs to the component:


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Let's fix the LSP errors by updating the API request calls in the mutations:


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Let's fix the remaining mutations with the correct format for apiRequest:


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Let's fix the remaining apiRequest mutations:


Executed grep -n "mutationFn" client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx | grep -A1 "apiRequest("

Opened client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
I'm analyzing your progress so far on implementing the admin functionality for FreelanceHub.

Looking at my progress:
✓ Added admin methods to interfaces and storage implementations
✓ Updated admin routes registration
✓ Enhanced AdminPanel.tsx with user management features
✓ Added forms for user creation, role management, and password reset
→ Working on fixing API request formatting in mutations

I'm making good progress implementing the admin functionality. The frontend components for user management are taking shape, but there are some issues with the apiRequest function format in the mutations that need to be fixed. I'll continue working on these fixes to ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend.


Restarted Start application
I see the server has restarted. Let's continue fixing the remaining apiRequest calls in the AdminPanel component to ensure they have the correct format.


Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx

Edited client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
Now let's check if we can see the Admin Panel in the frontend. We'll need to make sure it's accessible in the UI:


Restarted Start application
Let's check if there are any errors in the adminRoutes.ts file and make sure they're properly registered in routes.ts:


Opened server/routes/adminRoutes.ts

Opened server/routes.ts
Let's check if the admin routes are mounted:


Opened server/routes.ts
Let's continue checking where the routes are mounted:


Opened server/routes.ts
Let's look at the very end of the routes.ts file to find if the routes are mounted:


Executed grep -n "app.use" server/routes.ts
Now let's see if we can access the admin panel in the UI. We'll need to fix the API call format in the client code. Let's fix the roleAssignmentMutation and createUserMutation in AdminPanel.tsx:

Let's search for the roleAssignmentMutation in the file:


Executed grep -n "roleAssignmentMutation" client/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx
I'm analyzing your situation. It seems we're experiencing a connection issue with the web server, which is preventing us from testing the admin functionality we've been implementing.

I noticed we've fixed several API request formats in the AdminPanel.tsx component, but there are still some similar patterns that need updating. More importantly, the web server appears to be unreachable.

Should I focus on restarting the web server and troubleshooting the connection issue so we can see the admin panel in action?
